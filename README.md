ESILV A4 Project : "Clustering methods for price simulation python"

## Introduction 
Hello everyone,

I am thrilled to introduce our ESILV A4 project: "Clustering Methods for Price Simulation in Python." This project dives into the realm of data science and finance by exploring various clustering techniques to simulate price movements using Python.

In this GitHub repository, we have consolidated all the vital components of our project, including Python code implementations, documentation, and relevant resources. Our primary goal is to demonstrate how clustering methods can be leveraged to model and simulate price behaviors in financial markets.

Through this project, we aim to shed light on the efficacy of clustering algorithms in identifying patterns and structures within financial data, ultimately enabling more accurate price simulations and risk assessments.

We invite you to delve into our GitHub repository and engage with us by providing your insights, feedback, or inquiries. Your participation is crucial in fostering collaboration and advancing our understanding of clustering methods in financial modeling.

Thank you for joining us on this exciting journey of exploring clustering methods for price simulation in Python!

Best regards,
